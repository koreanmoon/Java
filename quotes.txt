It always seems impossible until it is done.
Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow.
Positive thinking will let you do everything better than negative thinking will.
It makes a big difference in your life when you stay positive.
If opportunity doesn’t knock, build a door.
You are never too old to set another goal or dream a new dream.
It’s not whether you get knocked down, it’s whether you get up.
Hard work keeps the wrinkles out of the mind and spirit.
If you want light to come into your life, you need to stand where it is shining.
Success is the sum of small efforts repeated day in and day out.
